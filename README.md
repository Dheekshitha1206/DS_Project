## Step 1
Make a folder in your device, add scratch.py file and one more folder named "templates". Inside the templates folder add index.html file.

## Step 2
Open any python code editor/compiler and add the folder in it. Now run the scratch.py file.

## Step 3
Generated code will render a website link, go to the link to open the website.

## Step 4
Choose from the adder or multipliers and number of bits. Hence the desired verilog code is generated.
